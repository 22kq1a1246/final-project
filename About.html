            mobile apps that are being used during app development by a custom software company
            Updated on: 3/1/2024
            
            Mobile applications have become big business in recent years; in fact, statistics show that 21 percent of millennials open an app more than 50 times per day. While there is no denying the popularity of apps, the sheer number of these custom software applications can make it difficult to see results when creating your own apps. As of August 2022, the Apple App Store has 4.567 million apps and games available, and the number of apps on the Google Play Store reached 3.57 million by July 2022. As such, it makes sense that your app will have to stand out if you want a lot of people to download it. In the end, it all comes down to app development.
            
            What is app development, though, you may ask? Put simply, app development is the process in which developers create an application to be used on smartphones, tablets and other mobile devices. While app development sometimes involves creating a web-based app or a desktop version of the app, the majority of app development projects are deployed to mobile and tablet devices. There are many features and considerations that factor into app development, which will be further explored in this article.
            
            Types Of Apps & What To Consider During Development
            There are multiple types of apps created by developers, such as native apps, HTML5 apps, and hybrid apps. A typical app uses a network connection to work with remote computing resources. Many companies opt to invest in custom app development to either improve work efficiency and streamline internal processes or push their ideas to the open market.
            
            When creating an app, developers must consider a variety of elements, such as screen size, configurations, and hardware specifications. Each component of a mobile app must come together to provide the end-user with a fast, clean, and easy-to-use interface design. Here are a few other things you will want to consider during app development.
            
            The Importance Of Cross-Platform Technologies
            a tablet that is used during testing for app developmentThe concept of cross-platform app development has become increasingly popular in the last few years. Cross-platform technologies allow developers to write code just once before releasing it to all platforms, including iOS, Android and Windows. This means that instead of writing fresh code for each individual platform, app developers can reuse the same code. This helps to save time and cut down on repetitive tasks.
            
            Cross-platform app development can also help businesses control costs. Companies now only need to make one investment to create an app instead of having to use numerous tools and technologies to accommodate all platforms. When cross-platform app development is used, end users can benefit from consistency. The app should look the same on all devices, regardless of whether the user is on an Android phone or an iPad.
            
            The App Development Lifecycle
            The app development lifecycle features several steps involved in a typical app development project. These steps include:
            
            1. Planning

            This first stage involves completing a business analysis and creating a mobile strategy. A business analyst, marketer and project manager are usually involved.

            2. Technical

            In this next stage, a technical writer is responsible for describing all technical details and requirements.
            
            3. Prototyping

            In the prototyping phase, the sketch, wireframes and app skins are created. This is usually completed by a UX/UI designer.

            4. Developing

            This phase includes front-end and back-end coding segments and is performed by developers.
            
            5. Quality Assurance

            During the quality assurance phase, tech requirements are tested and the device capability is reviewed to ensure that the app is working as it should.

            6. Publishing

            Finally, the app is published to the app store. Maintenance is provided on an ongoing basis as updates, new releases and new bugs arise.
            
             
            
            Front End vs. Back End Development
            During the coding process, developers encounter two main types of paths: front end and back end. What is the difference between these two concepts? Front-end developers focus on how an app looks, while back-end developers focus on how an app works. For example, if you were building an app, the front-end developer would be in charge of creating the theme, style, presentation, and images.
            
            The back-end developer would work on the database, as well as the site’s security, users and overall site performance. Programming languages can also differ. For example, front-end developers often use HTML, JavaScript, or CSS, while back-end users may use Ruby, PHP, Python, Java or Node.js.
            
            This is also commonly referred to as user interface & user experience (UI/UX). Generally, the UI is managed by front-end developers, while the UX is managed by back-end developers. Many app development professionals today are referred to as “full-stack” developers since they perform work on both the front and back ends.
            
            Key Features Of Mobile Applications
            a smartphone that is being used to research what app development isMobile apps often contain a wide range of features designed to enhance the user experience. When developing an app, you will want to think carefully about what features you want added to your software. Many features can contribute to the success of an app development project, including the following:
            
            Push Notifications
            Push notifications are an example of a feature often used by app developers. These notifications or messages create a direct line of communication between businesses and customers. Instead of developing cold email lists or sending out targeted ads, push notifications to work to establish a direct text or email relationship with users that already utilize your mobile application to further increase their interest in your brand.
            
            Integrations And Enhancements
            Another example of popular mobile app features include one-click contact, QR scanner integration, Google Indoor Maps, and augmented reality. Many businesses also rely on customized content, system functionality, and layouts to create a visual design that is both attractive and functional. Integrations with other existing applications or technologies can also improve the overall experience for the user.
            
            Speed And Security
            While these may seem like obvious features, speed and security are critical to app development. If an application uses technologies that are cookie-cutter, outdated, slow, or difficult to secure, it will likely be outperformed by custom applications that are fast, responsive and provide a sense of security to the user. Every custom app development project should produce a fast and secure product at a minimum to be considered a success.
